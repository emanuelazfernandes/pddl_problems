no metric specified. plan length assumed.
setting gtt = 1.0 to simulate STRIPS planning.


checking for cyclic := effects --- OK.display info is 1

ff: search configuration is EHC, if that fails then  best-first on 1*g(s) + 5*h(s) where
    metric is  plan length

Real initial cost 3.000000, with 3 actions


Cueing down from goal distance:   3.00 into depth [1]

ff: found legal plan (steps: 3) as follows
   0: (CLEAN GHOST LOCA)
   1: (MOVE GHOST LOCA LOCB)
   2: (CLEAN GHOST LOCB)
